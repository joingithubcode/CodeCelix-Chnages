## How to Get the Latest Code from Main Repo and Continue Your Work
- If you're not already inside your project folder, go to it: (cd CodeCelix_Official_Website)
- Add the Main Repo as "Upstream" (Only once do this) i.e., (git remote add upstream https://github.com/QasimFullStackDeveloper/CodeCelix_Official_Website.git)
- You can check if it worked: (git remote -v)
- git fetch upstream
- git checkout main
- git merge upstream/main
- git push origin main
- Now go back to the branch you were working in: (git checkout feature/your-feature-name)
- git merge main

## Note: To keep our codebase clean and stable, direct push to main is not allowed. All changes must go through a pull request (PR).
